**1.Project Title \& Description:**



\# Rover Rock Classification using Roboflow

This project classifies rocks (Granite, Basalt, Sandstone,Marble,Quartzite,Limestone,Coal) using images captured by a rover. 

The model is trained using Roboflow and can be used for real-time prediction.





**2.Dataset Information:**



The dataset used for this project is a publicly available rock classification dataset from Kaggle:  

\[Rock Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salmaneunus/rock-classification)



->Classes:Granite, Basalt, Sandstone,Marble,Quartzite,Limestone,Coal

->Images per class:200-500

->Used for training and testing the Roboflow model



The process used before training as follows:

\- Images were resized to 224x224 pixels

\- Data augmentation applied: rotation, flipping, brightness adjustment etc.
